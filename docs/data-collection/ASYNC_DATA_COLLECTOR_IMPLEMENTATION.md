# Async Data Collector Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of asynchronous data collection endpoints to prevent the application from freezing during long-running data collection operations.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the data collector endpoints were synchronous and would block the entire application while downloading market data, causing the app to become unresponsive.

## Solution

### 1. Task Manager (`app/services/task_manager.py`)

A comprehensive task management system that handles background operations:

- **Task States**: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with percentage and messages
- **Task Lifecycle**: Automatic cleanup of completed tasks after 5 minutes
- **Concurrent Limiting**: Maximum 5 concurrent tasks to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting

### 2. Enhanced Data Feeder (`app/services/data_feeder.py`)

New async methods added to the existing DataFeeder class:

- `collect_market_data_async()`: Async version with progress tracking
- `refresh_symbols_async()`: Async symbol refresh with progress updates
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time progress reporting via task manager
- **Error Resilience**: Individual symbol/timeframe failures don't stop the entire operation

### 3. Updated Data Collector API (`app/api/v1/data_collector.py`)

All endpoints are now asynchronous and return immediately:

#### New Endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/data-collector/start` - Start data collection (returns task_id)
- `GET /api/v1/data-collector/task/{task_id}` - Get specific task status
- `GET /api/v1/data-collector/tasks` - Get all tasks (optionally filtered by type)
- `GET /api/v1/data-collector/tasks/active` - Get active tasks only
- `POST /api/v1/data-collector/task/{task_id}/cancel` - Cancel a running task
- `GET /api/v1/data-collector/tasks/stats` - Get task statistics
- `POST /api/v1/data-collector/refresh-symbols` - Refresh symbols (async)

#### Updated Endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/data-collector/status` - Enhanced with task information
- `GET /api/v1/data-collector/latest-prices` - Remains synchronous (fast operation)

## Usage Examples

### 1. Start Data Collection

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data-collector/start" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbols": ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "ADAUSDT"],
    "timeframes": ["1m", "5m", "1h"]
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "submitted",
  "message": "Data collection task submitted successfully. Use the task_id to check status."
}
```

### 2. Check Task Status

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data-collector/task/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "task_type": "data_collection",
  "status": "running",
  "progress": 45,
  "message": "Collected data for ETHUSDT 5m (9/18)",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "started_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:01",
  "completed_at": null,
  "error": null,
  "result": null
}
```

### 3. Get Task Statistics

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data-collector/tasks/stats"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "task_counts": {
    "pending": 0,
    "running": 1,
    "completed": 5,
    "failed": 0,
    "cancelled": 0
  },
  "active_tasks_count": 1,
  "data_collector_status": {
    "symbols_count": 50,
    "timeframes": ["1m", "5m", "15m", "1h", "4h", "1d"],
    "available_symbols": ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "ADAUSDT", ...]
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Non-blocking Operations**: Application remains responsive during data collection
2. **Real-time Progress**: Users can track operation progress
3. **Error Resilience**: Individual failures don't stop entire operations
4. **Task Management**: Full lifecycle management of background tasks
5. **Resource Control**: Limits concurrent operations to prevent overload
6. **Cancellation Support**: Users can cancel long-running operations
7. **Historical Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all operations

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_async_data_collector.py
```

## Integration Notes

- Task manager is automatically initialized on application startup
- All background tasks are properly cleaned up on application shutdown
- The system is backward compatible - existing synchronous methods remain available
- WebSocket notifications continue to work for real-time updates

## Monitoring

Monitor task execution through:

1. **API Endpoints**: Real-time status checking
2. **Application Logs**: Structured logging with task IDs
3. **Task Statistics**: Comprehensive metrics and counts
4. **WebSocket Updates**: Real-time market data notifications

## Future Enhancements

- Task prioritization system
- Retry mechanisms for failed tasks
- Task scheduling capabilities
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Task result caching
